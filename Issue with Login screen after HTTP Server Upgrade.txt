Error details :
Unable to open Main URL: >> getting error: "The requested URL /OA_HTML/AppsLogin was not found on this server."

Status:
Due to some wrong planning we were supposed to start the MT services to perform certain Licensing work. But unfortunately we upgraded HTTP Server as part of R12.1.3 upgrade from 12.0.4.

Normally we will do all the tasks and then start the services to perform post health checks and releasing to the customer.

But in this case we got to start Apache and there we are stuck due to below issue.
Error : "The requested URL /OA_HTML/AppsLogin was not found on this server.".


Upon searching in Metalink found couple of direct hits. Most of them clearly mentioned that "it got resolved once all step till patch 7303030 and post patch step is completed ".

This is there as part of our plan later, but to reach to that point we need to do licensing.


Proactive approach: Planner should have done this licensing part before doing HTTP server.But we are doing Production and this crucial step wasn't taken care of....


Only option we have is to do steps from Note : Note: 1177264.1

1. Login to server
2:- Run adadmin

2a:- Choose the following options

1. Generate Applications Files menu
4. Generate product JAR files
Do you wish to force regeneration of all jar files? [YES] ?

3:- Shutdown the E-business suite middle tier services

4:- Run the ojspCompile.pl 

Run Autoconfig on MT & DB.
bring up application and retest issue 



FInally after performing issue got resolved...


Summary:- In case we need to start MT Services to see login page in the middle of R12.1.3 Upgrade like HTTP server upgrade is done follow note : 1177264.1 as mentioned above.
